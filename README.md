# CodeGraph Desktop

**English** | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

A desktop project manager for CodeGraph and Serena, built with **Tauri 2 + React + TypeScript + Vite**.

Each project runs its own CodeGraph instance with a separate index, runtime state, logs, and authentication token. One local HTTP service routes `/mcp/{project-id}` to the corresponding instance. Codex and Claude Code use project-level MCP configuration.

[GitHub repository](https://github.com/touwaeriol/codegraph-desktop) · [Download releases](https://github.com/touwaeriol/codegraph-desktop/releases) · [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/touwaeriol/codegraph-desktop/actions)

## Supported platforms

| Platform | Architecture | Packages |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows | AMD64, ARM64 | NSIS `.exe` |
| macOS | ARM64 (Apple Silicon) | `.dmg`, `.pkg` |
| Linux | AMD64, ARM64 | `.deb`, `.AppImage` |

A release is published only after all five native builds and checks succeed. Each platform includes a SHA-256 checksum file. Windows code signing and Apple signing/notarization are not currently configured.

The repository includes the React interface, Tauri/Rust backend, project gateway, and a compatibility connector for older configurations. See the [validation record (Chinese)](docs/05-validation.md) for completed checks and remaining acceptance work. Initial client trust, native window interactions, and installation on clean machines require separate acceptance testing.

## Installation and upgrades

Download the package for your system and architecture from [Releases](https://github.com/touwaeriol/codegraph-desktop/releases).

On Windows, an existing installation is updated in the same directory without uninstalling the previous version first. The application and connector are replaced together. A separate uninstall entry remains available in Windows Settings. Silent in-place upgrade and uninstall regression checks use an isolated test installation.

Before an update, the application is asked to stop managed CodeGraph processes and indexing tasks, then exit and release its executable files. Windows retains an exact-path process shutdown fallback for older versions. Linux DEB and macOS PKG installers wait for the application at the standard installation path to exit, and abort on timeout. DMG drag-and-drop installation and manual AppImage replacement have no pre-install hook: quit the application from its tray menu before replacing those files. Other projects' Node/CodeGraph processes are not globally terminated by name.

应用内自动更新已从 0.1.24 开始提供，支持启动检查、下载校验、安装与重启。0.1.23 及更早版本需先手动安装一次新版。平台范围和使用方法见[应用内更新说明](README.zh-CN.md#应用内更新)。

## Language

On first launch, the application uses the system's preferred display language: Chinese locales use Simplified Chinese; other languages fall back to English. Open **Settings → Display language**, choose **English** or **简体中文**, and save your preferences. The interface and tray menu update immediately, and your choice is retained across restarts.

The Windows installer automatically uses Simplified Chinese on Chinese-language systems and English otherwise, without a language-selection dialog. The macOS/Linux system installer interface follows the operating system's own language settings. Project names, paths, configuration contents, and raw CodeGraph output are preserved in their original language.

## MCP connections and configuration editing

- Project MCP services use the name `codegraph`. Codex and Claude Code connect directly to the local project gateway over Streamable HTTP. The gateway uses CodeGraph's native stdio transport upstream.
- The application persists one shared loopback port; each project keeps its own stable ID, authentication token, and MCP sessions. Endpoints use `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/mcp/<project-id>`. An occupied port causes an explicit error instead of silently changing ports. Start the project in the desktop application before connecting a client. Stopping one project leaves the shared service and other projects running.
- Existing application-managed HTTP configurations are backed up and migrated on startup when their ownership fingerprints still match. Manually modified entries are preserved and can be reviewed through **Preview and configure**. Global client configuration is not changed.
- **Settings** opens in the main workspace beside the project sidebar. Select a project to return to its workspace.
- Both engines share the same workspace layout and header controls. Settings presents CodeGraph and Serena as peer cards, side by side when space allows and stacked in narrower windows. General preferences are separate. The resizable desktop window supports a minimum size of 800 × 560.
- To migrate an older configuration, open **Preview and configure** again and review the change from command/args to a URL and authentication header. The compatibility connector remains bundled, but new configurations do not reference it.
- For each file in the preview, choose to merge settings, overwrite the entire file, or edit its complete contents. Overwriting removes other settings in that file; review the diff before applying it.
- After editing, refresh the preview. Syntax validation must pass before applying changes. Refreshing after an external editor changes the file preserves your draft in the preview window.
- If the original configuration cannot be parsed, open a preview in overwrite mode, then switch to editing to repair it. Opening the preview does not write the file.
- Applying a configuration backs up the original files and checks for external changes. Manually changing or removing the `codegraph` URL or authentication fields may disconnect that entry from the project and remove its managed status. Configuration contains local authentication credentials: do not upload or share these tokens.

## One-click activation

The sidebar shows one colored marker per MCP next to each project: C (CodeGraph), S (Serena), W (WarpGrep) and R (REA). A filled marker means the engine is running (for REA: registered with at least one client); markers pulse while starting or stopping and show a red outline on error.

Four clients are supported, each through its project-level file: Codex (`.codex/config.toml`), Claude Code (`.mcp.json`), Cursor (`.cursor/mcp.json`) and Devin (`.devin/mcp_config.json`). Global client configuration is not modified.

A project's four engines are listed vertically with their run state and one switch per client. Turning on a client's switch starts the engine if needed and, once it is running, adds it to that client's project configuration. Turning a switch off removes only that client's entry; the engine stops when its last client is turned off. REA has no managed process, so only its registrations change. Selecting a row switches the Overview, MCP configuration and logs below.

Sidebar markers are shortcuts: clicking one starts the engine and adds it to the default client chosen under **Icons enable in**; clicking again stops it and removes every entry this app wrote for it. The default client is shared with the MCP configuration list and kept across restarts. A failed start writes no configuration. Missing prerequisites are reported directly with an **Open Settings** action: no CodeGraph or Serena entry (Serena is detected automatically first when none is saved), no Morph API key for WarpGrep, or no `npx` for REA. A Node.js version outside REA's supported range only produces a warning.

Clients load project configuration differently: Cursor and Devin ask you to enable or trust project MCP servers, and Devin looks for `.devin/mcp_config.json` at the Git repository root. Tools disabled in Settings become a disabled list for Codex and Devin, an allowlist of the remaining tools for Cursor (after the tool list has been fetched once), and deny rules in `.claude/settings.json` for Claude Code.

REA runs inside each client, which manages analysis sessions itself through `open_binary` / `close_binary`. **REA sessions** on the REA overview lists the process trees clients started with `rea-agents … mcp`: client, PID, start time, process count and memory including Ghidra and other providers. **End** (after confirmation) ends a whole tree; that client must reload MCP to use REA again. **Clean up** ends only trees whose client has exited and deletes `rea-*` folders in the system temporary directory that are older than every running session. Other processes, including `rea doctor`, are never listed or ended.

When CodeGraph starts for a project without an index, the desktop first runs `codegraph init --yes` and then starts it; the operation can be cancelled. This applies to manual starts, one-click activation, **Start all CodeGraph** and resuming after a restart. Sync and rebuild on the **Code index** card are unchanged.

## Serena (optional)

Choose **Serena** in a project's engine switcher to manage semantic symbol search, references and editing separately from CodeGraph. It does not require a CodeGraph index. The sidebar reports both engines independently.

1. Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) and run `uv tool install -p 3.13 serena-agent`, following the [official Serena installation guide](https://oraios.github.io/serena/02-usage/010_installation.html).
2. In **Settings → Serena executable**, detect the executable or select it manually. Detection validates the CLI before saving it.
3. Select a project, choose **Serena**, and click **Start instance**. First use may download language-server dependencies; inspect **Logs** if startup or tools fail. Language-specific dependencies remain Serena's responsibility.
4. In **MCP configuration**, select CodeGraph and Serena together (the default), or select just one engine. Choose Codex and/or Claude Code, review one combined preview, and apply once. Each project file is written once, with a shared backup and rollback. Merge preserves other settings; overwrite and manual editing remain available. Only the project `.codex/config.toml` / `.mcp.json` files are changed.

Serena runs its native Streamable HTTP server at `http://127.0.0.1:<project-port>/mcp` in `--context ide --project <absolute-path>` single-project mode. Each project has a stable independent port; an occupied port fails instead of switching. Clients connect directly, preserving Serena's tools and instructions. Startup checks for symbol tools and rejects servers that expose project switching. Native Serena endpoints do not use CodeGraph bearer tokens and are intended for trusted local clients. Single-project mode is not an OS sandbox.

Stopping Serena leaves CodeGraph and other projects running. Application exit, installer-requested shutdown, project removal/relocation, and **Stop all** also stop owned Serena process trees. Engines resume across restarts: every CodeGraph, Serena and WarpGrep instance that was running when the desktop exited (including an installer update, which also relaunches the app) starts again on the next launch, recorded in `engine-resume.json` in the application data directory. Stopping an engine, or a failed start, removes it from that list; project autostart still starts CodeGraph. Binaries are not bundled: an installed Serena executable is required. Language servers that Serena does not install itself are installed automatically before it starts, or after it reports one failed: currently `gopls` for Go, into the application data directory and placed first on Serena's PATH, using the system proxy when no `HTTPS_PROXY` is set. Servers without a recipe are reported on the Serena panel instead of silently failing. Windows native HTTP and symbol queries were tested with Serena 1.7.0, and macOS with Serena 2.0.0. Serena 2 defaults to its REPL interface; when the entry supports `--agent-interface`, the desktop explicitly selects the per-tool interface and the LSP backend without editing `~/.serena/serena_config.yml`. On macOS/Linux, launches from Finder or a desktop launcher adopt the login shell's PATH ahead of the inherited one, so commands installed with Homebrew, npm or uv (such as `npx` and `go`) are visible to engines and the REA test.

## WarpGrep (optional)

[Morph WarpGrep](https://docs.morphllm.com/sdk/components/warp-grep) is a natural-language code search subagent: the `morph-warp-grep-v2.1` model plans several rounds of grep, listing and file reads, and returns the relevant files and line ranges. The desktop app implements the WarpGrep protocol natively in the project gateway, so no Node package or `npx` process is needed.

1. Create an API key in the [Morph dashboard](https://morphllm.com/dashboard/api-keys).
2. In **Settings → WarpGrep**, paste the key and click **Validate and save**. The key is saved only after one real WarpGrep model call succeeds (about 1K tokens); invalid keys, missing credit, rate limits and network failures are reported and nothing is saved. Settings only display a masked hint. **Remove** deletes the key and stops every running WarpGrep route.
3. Select a project, choose **WarpGrep**, and click **Start instance**. Starting is refused until a validated key exists. No CodeGraph index is required.
4. In **MCP configuration**, select WarpGrep (available once a key is validated) together with any other engines and apply. Clients receive a `warpgrep` entry pointing at `http://127.0.0.1:<shared-port>/warpgrep/<project-id>` with the project's bearer token.

The route exposes exactly one read-only tool, `codebase_search` (`search_string`; optional `includeSource`, default false, which returns only file paths and line ranges unless set to true; optional `maxChars`, default 12,000). The model's grep/read/list/glob calls run locally and only inside the bound project root: absolute paths, `..` traversal and symlinks resolving outside the project are rejected, and common dependency/build directories, hidden files, nested repositories and git worktrees, binaries and files over 2 MB are skipped. Each search is limited to 6 turns and 100 seconds (below Codex's 120-second tool timeout), with at most 4 concurrent searches per project; a model request that stalls for 20 seconds or fails transiently is retried once. Each search turn's model time and tool calls are written to the project's Logs.

The Morph API key is stored in the application database inside the owner-only application data directory; it is never written to project configuration files. **Code excerpts read during a search are sent to the Morph API** — confirm this is acceptable for each project before enabling it. Stopping WarpGrep, removing/relocating the project, **Stop all** and application exit unregister the route.

## Local development

Prerequisites: Node.js 22+, Rust stable, and a local CodeGraph installation. Install the [Tauri native build prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) for your system: MSVC, Windows SDK, and WebView2 on Windows; Xcode Command Line Tools on macOS; WebKitGTK 4.1, GTK, and AppIndicator dependencies on Linux. Each architecture is built on its native environment.

```sh
npm ci

# Browser preview shows that the desktop backend is disconnected;
# it does not generate fake projects.
npm run dev

# Check or package any of the five supported native targets.
node scripts/build-desktop.mjs Check
node scripts/build-desktop.mjs Bundle

# Launch the desktop application, preparing its connector first.
node scripts/build-desktop.mjs Dev
```

Additional Windows PowerShell entry points:

```powershell
# Build the connector, check the frontend, and run Rust tests and Clippy.
./scripts/build-desktop.ps1 -Mode Check

# Test two projects and two MCP clients against a real CodeGraph instance.
./scripts/build-desktop.ps1 -Mode Mcp

# Launch the desktop application.
./scripts/build-desktop.ps1 -Mode Dev

# Build the Windows NSIS installer, including the connector.
./scripts/build-desktop.ps1 -Mode Bundle
```

Raw packages are written to `target/release/bundle/`. Standardized packages and checksum files are written to `target/release-assets/<platform>-<architecture>/`. The CI workflow is `.github/workflows/desktop.yml`.

The `Mcp` mode uses the current user's npm-installed CodeGraph by default. Override its location with `-CodeGraphBundle` and `-CodeGraphEntry`. Sample projects are created in temporary directories; user projects are not modified. This mode uses simulated MCP clients and does not replace integration testing with actual Codex or Claude Code clients. See the [client testing guide (Chinese)](tests/clients/README.md) for real-client scripts and model-service limitations.

Before invoking `cargo test --workspace` or `npm run tauri` directly, generate the connector sidecar required by Tauri. The build scripts handle its platform-specific filename. They check development dependencies but do not install system tools automatically.

## Design and release documentation

Detailed engineering documents are currently in Chinese:

- [Product requirements and scope](docs/01-product-requirements.md): workflows, project isolation, initial scope, and acceptance criteria.
- [System design](docs/02-system-design.md): process architecture, MCP bridging, data model, configuration writes, and runtime lifecycle.
- [UI design](docs/03-ui-design.md): navigation, page wireframes, visual rules, interactions, and error states.
- [Implementation and acceptance plan](docs/04-implementation-plan.md): technical validation, implementation order, test scenarios, and release requirements.
- [Validation record](docs/05-validation.md): completed checks and remaining acceptance work.
- [Release guide](docs/06-release.md): version tags, GitHub Actions, package upgrades, and files excluded from the public repository.

## Core conventions

1. Each started project has one managed CodeGraph service instance, which may include CodeGraph's own worker processes.
2. Projects do not share running instances, index databases, or request queues.
3. Codex and Claude Code for the same project share its instance. Adding a client does not start a second CodeGraph instance.
4. Projects can share one CodeGraph installation; separate instances do not require repeated installations.
5. MCP settings are written to the project's `.codex/config.toml`, `.mcp.json`, `.cursor/mcp.json` and `.devin/mcp_config.json`. Global client configuration is not modified.
6. Access is local-only by default. Exiting stops managed services; closing the window leaves the application running in the tray by default.

## Reading notes

Documentation updated on October 4, 2026. GitHub Actions provides the actual build results for the five native targets above. The initial validation baseline used CodeGraph 1.6.2 on the development machine; this is not a claim that it will remain the latest version.

Project names, UUIDs, ports, and paths in diagrams are examples, not evidence that those instances have been created or started.
